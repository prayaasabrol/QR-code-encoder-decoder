# QR code encoder/decoder
A QR code encoder creates QR codes from data, and a QR code decoder reads and interprets the information stored within a QR code.
A QR code encoder is a tool or software that takes input data, such as a website URL, text, or other information, and converts it into a QR code. This QR code can then be printed or displayed digitally for users to scan with their smartphones or other devices.

On the other hand, a QR code decoder is a tool or software that can read and interpret the information stored within a QR code. When a user scans a QR code with their device's camera, the QR code decoder app or software processes the image and extracts the encoded data, which could be a website link, text, contact information, or any other type of data that was originally encoded into the QR code.

In summary, a QR code encoder creates QR codes from input data, while a QR code decoder reads and interprets the information stored within a QR code. These tools are commonly used for sharing information, accessing websites, making payments, and various other applications that benefit from quick and easy data transfer using QR codes.
